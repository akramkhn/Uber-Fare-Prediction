Uber Ride Fare Prediction

Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the fare of Uber rides. By analyzing historical ride data and leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide accurate fare estimates to users, improving their experience with the Uber service.

Steps Taken
1. Data Loading and Data Cleaning using Pandas
   
We loaded the dataset into the Python environment using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library. Through data cleaning, we handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data inconsistencies, ensuring the quality and reliability of the dataset for analysis and modeling.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the dataset's structure and uncover hidden patterns. Using summary statistics, data visualization techniques (such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots), and correlation analysis, we explored relationships between variables and identified potential predictors of ride fares.

5. Feature Engineering
   
Feature engineering involved creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the machine learning model. Techniques such as encoding categorical variables, deriving new variables from existing ones, and extracting information from date-time variables were employed to enrich the feature space and improve model performance.

7. Feature Selection
   
Feature selection is crucial for building efficient and interpretable machine learning models. We selected relevant features and removed irrelevant or redundant ones to reduce dimensionality and mitigate overfitting. This was done using statistical tests, feature importance scores, and domain knowledge to identify the most influential predictors of ride fares.

9. Building Machine Learning Model using Ensemble Technique
    
To construct the Uber ride fare prediction model, we employed ensemble learning techniques. Ensemble methods combine multiple base models to produce a stronger and more robust predictor. Techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Bagging were utilized to train the model on the cleaned and engineered dataset. The model was evaluated using appropriate performance metrics and fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization to achieve optimal predictive accuracy.
